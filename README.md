Efficient Access Protocols for High Storage RFID

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5508211

## Abstract

In this work, we introduce the problem of reading and writing to a system of high storage passive RFID tags. We consider design goals, based on motivating applications. We consider access protocols and provide preliminary performance results. Future work includes defining more detailed access protocols (and in which scenarios they are applicable). We also plan to evaluate these protocols more extensively through simulations and experiments using RFID hardware.
